# Passing a secret to a TPM using only the public key of Endorsement Key (EK)

This is example code to pass a secret to a system by just knowing its endorsenment key's public key.
We will be using the current (commit 07a92e9fa75548ea102ce90b3b6182093b3f7a73 or later) master branch of https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pytss

The terms for the systems are `client`, the system we want to send the secret to and `server`, the system which has the secret.
One assumtion that will be made is that the `server` already securely knows the `client`'s EKpub.

## Background

What we want is something akin to asymmetric encryption, with the local
system encrypting to the public key of the remote system.  The local
system would send the ciphertext to the remote system, and the remote
system would decrypt it using its private key.

The TPM does support plain asymmetric decryption using
`TPM2_RSA_Decrypt()`.  However, the `EK` is a [restricted
key](/Intro/README.md#Restricted-Cryptographic-Keys), specifically a
[restricted decryption key](/Intro/README.md#Restricted-Decryption-Keys)
which means that `TPM2_RSA_Decrypt()` will not work.

The TPM supports two constrained asymmetric decryption operations with
[restricted decryption
keys](/Intro/README.md#Restricted-Decryption-Keys):

 - [`TPM2_Import()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_Import.md)
 - [`TPM2_ActivateCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_ActivateCredential.md)

The sender sides of those two functions are, respectively:

 - [`TPM2_Duplicate()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_Duplicate.md)
 - [`TPM2_MakeCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_MakeCredential.md)

`TPM2_Duplicate()`/`TPM2_Import()` are specifically about sharing
private key objects from one TPM to another.  We won't use those here.

[`TPM2_MakeCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_MakeCredential.md) allows
us to encrypt a small secret (e.g., an AES key) to a remote system's
`EKpub`, and then the remote system can decrypt that with its `EK` using
[`TPM2_ActivateCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_ActivateCredential.md).

The key background concepts here are:

 - [restricted decryption keys](/Intro/README.md#Restricted-Decryption-Keys),
 - and access controlled decryption with restricted decryption keys.

Most importantly,
[`TPM2_MakeCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_MakeCredential.md) allows
the sender to specify an authorization policy that the caller of
[`TPM2_ActivateCredential()`](/TPM-Commands/TPM2_ActivateCredential.md)
must meet in order for it to be willing to decrypt the ciphertext.

> Note that `TPM2_MakeCredential()` can be implemented entirely in
> software.

> Note that duplicating a key that is fixed to TPMs requires using
> `TPM2_Duplicate()` on that TPM, otherwise if the key is not fixed to
> the TPM then `TPM2_Duplicate()` can be implemented in software.

## Concept

`TPM2_MakeCredential()` requires three inputs.  Besides the target's
`EKpub` and the small secret to send to it, `TPM2_MakeCredential()` also
requires the [cryptographic name](/Intro/README.md#Cryptographic-Object-Naming)
of a key object that must reside on the target system's TPM -- this is
known as the _activation object_.

The key insight is that the actual public key of the object named by the
activation object name input of `TPM2_MakeCredential()` is not used at
all.  Neither does `TPM2_ActivateCredential()` use the private key of
that object.  The only things that matter about the activation object
are that:

a) it must exist on the target system,
b) its cryptographic name must be the same as was used on the sender side,
c) and that the caller of `TPM2_ActivateCredential()` must satisfy the activation object's [_authorization policy_](/Intro/README.md#Policies) (_if_ `adminWithPolicy` is set as an attribute of the activation object).

> NOTE: The cryptographic name of an object binds the authorization
> policy set on that object.  Therefore the caller of
> `TPM2_MakeCredential()` specifies an authorization policy that the
> caller of `TPM2_ActivateCredential()` must meet if the
> `adminWithPolicy` attribute is set on the activation object.

> NOTE: Learn more about [restricted keys](/Intro/README.md#Restricted-Cryptographic-Keys),
> [authorization policies](/Intro/README.md#Policies), and
> user roles in our [introductory tutorial](/Intro/README.md).

Since the private and public key parts of the activation object are not
used and are irrelevant, they can even be fixed and published for all to
see, even the private key.

By using a well-known activation key we can avoid having to know the
cryptographic name of some unique object on the remote system's TPM!

Or we can generate a unique key but send its private part in the clear
to the remote system.

Thus we need only know the target system's TPM's `EKpub`.

Generate the EK context with `tpm2_createek -c ek.ctx`
The arguments are:
ek-ctx: the context generated by tpm2_createek
temp-public: the temp-public output from the local system script
temp-sensitive: the temp-sensitive output from the local system script
credblob: the credblob output from the local system script
secret: the secret output from the local system script

## Example (bash)

This example uses two bash scripts:

 - [`send-to-tpm.sh`](send-to-tpm.sh)
 - [`tpm-receive.sh`](tpm-receive.sh)

Usage messages for those two scripts:

```
Usage: send-to-tpm.sh EK-PUB-FILE SECRET-FILE OUT-FILE [POLICY-CMD [ARGS [\; ...]]]
       send-to-tpm.sh -P well-known-key-name EK-PUB-FILE SECRET-FILE OUT-FILE

    Options:

     -h         This help message.
     -P WKname  Use the given cryptographic name binding a policy for
                recipient to meet.
     -f         Overwrite OUT-FILE.
     -x         Trace this script.
```

```
Usage: receive.sh CIPHERTEXT-FILE OUT-FILE [POLICY-CMD [ARGS] [;] ...]

  "Activates" (decrypts) CIPHERTEXT-FILE made with TPM2_MakeCredential and
  writes the plaintext to OUT-FILE.

  The POLICY-CMD and arguments are one or more commands that must
  leave a policy digest in a file named 'policy' in the current
  directory (which will be a temporary directory).

    Options:

     -h         This help message.
     -f         Overwrite OUT-FILE.
     -x         Trace this script.
```

Example (without policy, both scripts running on the same system):

```

You can pass policy commands to the `send-to-tpm.sh` and `tpm-receive.sh`
commands as arguments, with multiple policy commands separated by a
single semi-colon (quoted, to avoid evaluation by the shell):

```bash
send-to-tpm.sh ek.pub /tmp/secret /tmp/cipher \
          tpm2 policypcr -S session.ctx -l "sha256:0,1,2,3" -f $PWD/pcr.dat \
                         -L policy \; \
          tpm2 policycommandcode -S session.ctx -L policy TPM2_CC_ActivateCredential
```

## Issues

 - The secret sent this way has to be small: no larger than the digest
   size for the digest algorithm being used.

   If the application needs to send larger secrets, then it should
   generate an AES key and send that as the small secret, then encrypt
   the larger secret in the AES key and send that ciphertext.  (But
   don't forget to also include an HMAC or MAC of the ciphertext to make
   detection of errors / tampering possible.)

 - There is no protection against replay attacks in this example.

   Replay protection can be added by adding a timestamp to the secret
   data, and by using a replay cache on the remote system.

 - There is no authentication of the sender.  To authenticate the sender
   simply add a digital signature of the ciphertext.
